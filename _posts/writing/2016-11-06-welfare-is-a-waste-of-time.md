description: Being on welfare sucks up huge amounts of time. My app keeps track of it all.

The Australian Governemnt has characterised welfare recipients as 'leaners', coasting on free money from honest, hardworking taxpayers. Implicit in this characterisation is the idea that being on welfare is easy:

> In the last financial year, not a single person suffered a financial penalty (i.e. actually lost any welfare payments) for failure to job search.  Many had suspensions, but all were fully backdated... We don’t help anyone by excusing poor behaviour. It simply entrenches disadvantage and robs them of opportunity.

The key phrase in the Minister's quote, 'actually lost any welfare', masks a world of pain and frustration. Anyone who's been on a Centrelink payment before will tell you that payments are often suspended for bewildering and oblique reasons: the form that you scanned on the app was lost, Centrelink needs documentation that it already has, or you tried to do the right thing by reporting a minor change. If you have to deal with a Job Services Provider, your payment [hangs on their whim](https://newmatilda.com/2016/11/05/turns-out-being-in-hospital-doesnt-excuse-you-from-work-for-the-dole/).

Centrelink payments are already [well below the poverty line](http://www.bca.com.au/publications/submission-to-the-senate-inquiry-into-the-adequacy-of-the-allowance-payment-system-for-jobseekers-and-others), so having your payment frozen isn't trivial. Saving money is virtually impossible. Your payment could be backdated days, weeks or even months later—by which time you've missed rent payments, asked for bill extensions and gone without food.

Welfare recipients spend a lot of their time trying to prevent this from happening. Proactively following up on mysteriously suspended payments, contradictory letters sent within days of each other and ridiculous paperwork requirements wastes hours of time each week—time that jobseekers need to, y'know, _find a job_. Time that students need to study. Hell, time that recipients need to _survive_.

### Please Hold tracks the time you spend with Centrelink.###

I wrote [**Please Hold**](http://rensa.co/please-hold) to quantify this prodigious waste of time. Pull the app out whenever you need to do something to keep your payments going, whether it's call someone, visit an office, fill out a form or collect documentation. Please Hold will timestamp your answers so that you can keep a log of every minute you spend doing fuck all.

Importantly, Please Hold is entirely local: none of your data leaves your device (unless you choose to share it, of course). This isn't designed to aggregate the population's experience; it's designed to help you say, "This is real!" whenever some arsehole tells you to hurry up and get a job.

### What still needs to be done?

There are still a few features planned:
-  Export data and clear the storage out. I'm not sure whether a nice PDF or text report is more useful than a spreadsheet, but in a pinch you can copy-paste stuff off the page.
- More specific questions and more diverse experiences. I only have my own experiences with Centrelink to go by; if you feel like Please Hold doesn't capture yours very well, let me know by [dropping me a tweet](http://twitter.com/rensa_co) or [emailing me](mailto:me@rensa.co)!
- I'm not sure how accessible the site is, particularly to screen readers. it should be keyboard-accessible and I've tried to stick to HTML5 semantics, but I haven't done any testing on this front (ye!). If you have any feedback on this front, I'd love to hear it! 

### So why d'you hate Centrelink so much? ###

I'm frustrated with an inflexible system that often feels designed to punish people. Centrelink staff, on the other hand, are unfailingly helpful and sympathetic, even when they have to deal with my stroppy arse after I've been on hold for an hour. Thanks for doing everything you can to support us.
